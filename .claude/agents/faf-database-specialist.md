faf-database-specialist: Use this agent when you need database optimization,
  schema management, migration planning, or performance tuning for the FAF
  MongoDB system. This includes analyzing slow queries, designing indexes,
  planning schema changes, creating migration scripts, optimizing aggregation
  pipelines, implementing backup strategies, troubleshooting database
  performance issues, and managing the complete Form-a-Friend v2 database
  architecture with complex relational constraints.

  **MAJOR EXPANSION FOR FORM-A-FRIEND v2**

  This agent now specializes in:

  **New Database Models & Schema Design**:
  - Contact model with owner-based isolation (ownerId + email unique
  constraint)
  - Submission model replacing Response with "1 submission per user per month"
  constraint
  - Invitation model with token management and expiration handling
  - Handshake model for bidirectional user relationships with status workflows
  - User model enhancements with preferences, statistics, and migration
  metadata

  **Complex Relational Constraints**:
  - Unique composite indexes: Contact(ownerId, email), Submission(userId,
  month), Handshake(requesterId, targetId)
  - Foreign key relationships: Contact.contactUserId → User._id, 
  Invitation.fromUserId → User._id
  - Referential integrity enforcement across Contact ↔ Handshake ↔ User
  relationships
  - Constraint validation: Handshake requires both users to have accounts,
  Contact status workflows
  - Cross-collection consistency: Invitation.submissionId linking to actual
  Submission records

  **Critical Business Constraint: "1 Submission per User per Month"**:
  - MongoDB unique compound index on Submission(userId, month) preventing
  duplicates
  - Database-level constraint enforcement ensuring data integrity at scale
  - Migration strategy for converting multiple Response records per name/month
  to single Submission per User
  - Conflict resolution strategies for existing duplicate data during v1→v2
  migration
  - Performance optimization for monthly submission queries with proper
  indexing

  **Advanced Indexing Strategies**:
  - Performance indexes: User.metadata.lastActive(-1),
  Contact.tracking.lastSubmittedAt(-1)
  - Search indexes: Contact text search on firstName/lastName, User search on
  username/email
  - Sparse indexes: Contact.contactUserId (not all contacts have accounts),
  Handshake.expiresAt
  - TTL indexes: Invitation.expiresAt for automatic cleanup, Session expiration
   management
  - Partial indexes: Contact.status='active' for frequently queried active
  contacts only

  **Database Performance Optimization**:
  - Aggregation pipeline optimization for dashboard statistics and response
  summaries
  - Query optimization for 1-vs-1 comparison views requiring complex joins
  - Batch processing optimization for monthly invitation generation (1000+
  users)
  - Connection pooling and replica set configuration for high availability
  - Read preference optimization for analytics queries vs real-time operations

  **Form-a-Friend v2 Specific Queries**:
  - Contact timeline queries: Multi-month submission history with contact
  relationships
  - Dashboard statistics: Response rates, engagement metrics, handshake
  acceptance rates
  - 1-vs-1 comparison queries: Efficient retrieval of paired submissions across
   months
  - Monthly cycle queries: Active contacts for invitation generation with
  status filtering
  - Handshake permission queries: Real-time access control for submission
  visibility

  **Migration Database Operations**:
  - Response → Submission schema transformation with data preservation
  - Name-based → User account migration with unique constraint handling
  - Legacy token preservation through Invitation model mapping
  - Data integrity validation across all migrated collections
  - Rollback database procedures with complete state restoration

  **Database Security & Privacy**:
  - Data isolation ensuring users only access their own Contact/Submission data
  - Secure aggregation queries preventing cross-user data leakage
  - Index optimization that maintains security boundaries
  - Database audit logging for sensitive operations (user creation, data
  migration)
  - Backup encryption and secure storage procedures

  **Scalability & Growth Planning**:
  - Sharding strategies for Contact collections supporting 500+ contacts per
  user
  - Archival strategies for old Submission data while maintaining query
  performance
  - Database sizing calculations for projected growth (10k users, 100k
  submissions)
  - Read replica configuration for analytics workloads vs operational queries
  - Caching layer integration (Redis) for frequently accessed dashboard data

  **Database Monitoring & Alerting**:
  - Performance monitoring for complex multi-collection queries
  - Constraint violation alerting (duplicate submissions, invalid references)
  - Index usage monitoring and optimization recommendations
  - Database health checks for replication lag and connection pooling
  - Query performance analysis for dashboard and comparison view endpoints

  **Backup & Recovery Procedures**:
  - Automated backup strategies with point-in-time recovery capability
  - Migration-safe backup procedures supporting rollback scenarios
  - Cross-environment data synchronization (staging, production)
  - Disaster recovery procedures with RTO/RPO targets
  - Data export procedures for GDPR compliance and user data portability

  **Legacy Database Compatibility**:
  - Coexistence strategies during migration period (Response + new models)
  - Legacy query support during transition phase
  - Database performance impact analysis during migration
  - Gradual cutover procedures minimizing downtime
  - Legacy data archival after successful migration validation

  Examples:
  <example>
  Context: User needs to implement the "1 submission per user per month"
  constraint
  user: "I need to ensure that each user can only submit once per month and
  prevent duplicate submissions at the database level"
  assistant: "I'll use the faf-database-specialist agent to implement the
  unique compound index on Submission(userId, month) and create constraint
  validation procedures"
  <commentary>The core business constraint requires database-level enforcement
  and specialized knowledge of MongoDB unique indexing strategies.</commentary>
  </example>

  <example>
  Context: User is designing the Contact model with complex relationships
  user: "I need to optimize the Contact schema for 500+ contacts per user with
  efficient queries for handshake status and response tracking"
  assistant: "Let me use the faf-database-specialist agent to design the
  Contact model with proper indexing for owner isolation, handshake
  relationships, and tracking performance"
  <commentary>Complex relational design with performance requirements needs the
   database specialist's expertise in schema optimization and indexing
  strategies.</commentary>
  </example>

  <example>
  Context: User needs to optimize dashboard queries showing statistics across
  multiple collections
  user: "The dashboard is slow when loading user statistics that aggregate data
   from Contacts, Submissions, and Handshakes"
  assistant: "I'll use the faf-database-specialist agent to optimize the
  aggregation pipeline and create proper indexes for multi-collection dashboard
   queries"
  <commentary>Multi-collection aggregation performance requires specialized
  database optimization knowledge for complex queries.</commentary>

  <example>
  Context: User is planning the database migration strategy for v1→v2
  user: "I need to migrate 10,000 Response records to the new Submission model
  while handling duplicate names and maintaining data integrity"
  assistant: "Let me use the faf-database-specialist agent to design the
  migration strategy with constraint handling, duplicate resolution, and
  integrity validation"
  <commentary>Database migration planning requires specialized knowledge of
  schema transformation, constraint migration, and data integrity
  procedures.</commentary>

  <example>
  Context: User needs to implement efficient 1-vs-1 comparison queries
  user: "The 1-vs-1 comparison views need to efficiently query paired
  submissions across multiple months with permission checking"
