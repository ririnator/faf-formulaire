---

## Writing Guidelines

### Règle #1 : Clarity Over Cleverness

**Principe :**
Un message clair bat toujours un message "smart" que personne ne comprend.

**Application :**

✅ **Good:**
"Monthly check-ins. Guided questions. Private spaces. That's it."

❌ **Bad:**
"Leverage our proprietary relational architecture framework to optimize your social capital ROI."

---

### Règle #2 : Show, Don't Tell

**Principe :**
Démontrer la valeur avec des détails concrets, pas des adjectifs vagues.

**Application :**

✅ **Good:**
"Your best friend got engaged. You found out on Instagram."
→ Situation concrète, émotionnellement chargée

❌ **Bad:**
"Maintain meaningful connections with your important relationships."
→ Vague, sans impact émotionnel

---

### Règle #3 : One Idea Per Sentence

**Principe :**
Phrases courtes. Une idée à la fois. Facile à scanner.

**Application :**

✅ **Good:**
"WhatsApp groups die. Calendar reminders don't tell you what to say. Instagram creates an illusion of closeness."

❌ **Bad:**
"While WhatsApp groups tend to become inactive over time and calendar reminders lack contextual guidance for meaningful conversation starters, Instagram often provides a false sense of connection despite its superficial nature."

---

### Règle #4 : Active Voice > Passive Voice

**Principe :**
Écriture directe, énergique. Pas de passif mou.

**Application :**

✅ **Good:**
"You create the form. You share the link. You collect responses."

❌ **Bad:**
"The form is created by the user. The link can be shared. Responses are collected."

---

### Règle #5 : Remove Unnecessary Words

**Principe :**
Si un mot peut être supprimé sans changer le sens, supprime-le.

**Application :**

✅ **Good:**
"Build the system now."

❌ **Bad:**
"Take action to build the system now in order to achieve your goals."

---

### Règle #6 : Contractions Are Fine (En Anglais)

**Principe :**
On parle comme des humains. Contractions = naturel.

**Application :**

✅ **Good:**
"It's not for everyone. And that's okay."

❌ **Bad:**
"It is not for everyone. And that is acceptable."

**Note :** En français, pas de contractions mais on garde le ton conversationnel.

## Tone par Contexte

### Contexte 1 : Landing Page (Hero Section)

**Tone :** Direct + Emotional hook

**Structure :**
1. **Problem statement** (emotional, concrete)
2. **Solution introduction** (simple, clear)
3. **CTA** (direct, no pressure)

**Exemple :**

```
[H1] Stop losing your friends to distance and time.

[Subheader] Stay actually close with the people who matter.
One monthly check-in at a time.

[CTA] Start Free Trial - €12/month after 7 days
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- H1 : Direct, addresss the pain immediately
- Subheader : Outcome + How (simple)
- CTA : Honnête sur le prix, pas de tricks

---

### Contexte 2 : About / Philosophy Page

**Tone :** Inspirant + Intentionnel (c'est le moment d'élever)

**Structure :**
1. **The problem** (everyone waits)
2. **The alternative** (be proactive)
3. **The philosophy** (life FROM you)
4. **The invitation** (join if you get it)

**Exemple :**

```
Most people wait for the crisis.

They wait until they feel lonely.
Until they see that Instagram post.
Until they realize they don't know what's happening in their friends' lives anymore.

But what if you didn't have to wait?

Form-a-Friend is for people who want to be intentional about their relationships.
Who understand that staying close doesn't happen by accident—it happens by design.

One monthly check-in. One simple system. That's all it takes.

You could be the master of your fate, the captain of your soul.
But you have to realize that life is coming from you and not at you.

If that resonates, welcome. You're in the right place.
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- Start direct (problem)
- Shift inspirational (philosophy)
- End with invitation (selective)

---

### Contexte 3 : Product Features

**Tone :** Direct + Factuel (no fluff, just facts)

**Structure :**
- Feature name (clear)
- What it does (one sentence)
- Why it matters (benefit)

**Exemple :**

```
✅ Monthly Guided Questions
Questions that go deeper than "how are you?"
→ Structure without pressure.

✅ Private Comparisons
Each friend sees only their own comparison.
→ Intimacy preserved.

✅ Automatic Follow-Up
Track responses over time.
→ See the evolution, deepen progressively.
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- Ultra-scannable
- Benefit immédiat clair
- Pas de marketing speak

---

### Contexte 4 : Objection Handling

**Tone :** Honnête + Assume tes choix

**Structure :**
1. **Acknowledge objection** (don't dismiss)
2. **Explain rationale** (honest reason)
3. **Qualify or disqualify** (it's ok if not for them)

**Exemple :**

**Q: "€12/mois c'est cher pour un formulaire"**

```
A: You're not paying for a form.

You're paying for:
- A system that prevents your friends from becoming strangers
- Structure that removes the "I don't know what to say" paralysis  
- Private spaces for real conversations
- Automatic follow-up that shows evolution over time
- Your friendships staying alive

€12/mois = €0.40/jour.

Compare that to:
- Your gym: €40/month (your body)
- Netflix: €14/month (entertainment)  
- Spotify: €10/month (music)

If you invest €40/month in your physical health,
why not €12/month in your relational health?

The real question isn't "Can I afford €12?"
The real question is "What's the cost of losing a close friend?"

If €12/month feels expensive for that, FAF probably isn't for you.
And that's okay.

We're not for everyone. We're for people who value their friendships enough to invest.
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- Reframe (pas un formulaire)
- Value breakdown (transparent)
- Price anchoring (gym €40, Netflix €14)
- Assume (not for everyone)
- No desperation (take it or leave it)
- Question finale puissante (coût de perdre un ami)

---

**Q: "Pourquoi pas €5 comme Letterloop ?"**

```
A: Because FAF isn't Letterloop.

Letterloop ($5/month):
- Group newsletter for staying in touch
- Passive sharing ("here's my week")
- Generic questions for everyone
- Email only

Form-a-Friend (€12/month):
- 1-on-1 deepening system
- Active conversations ("let's explore this together")
- Personalized questions for each relationship
- Full dashboard + private comparisons + temporal tracking

You're not paying 2.4x more for "the same thing."
You're paying for a fundamentally different experience.

Think of it this way:
- Letterloop = Staying in the radar (maintenance)
- FAF = Going deeper progressively (growth)

If you just want to stay updated, Letterloop is perfect.
If you want to transform "catchup friends" into real connections, FAF is for you.

Different products. Different outcomes. Different prices.
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- Acknowledge le concurrent directement (honnêteté)
- Tableau comparatif clair (visual dans le mental)
- Reframe : pas "plus cher", mais "différent"
- Qualifie : aide Emma à se auto-sélectionner
- Pas de dénigrement de Letterloop (respect)

---

**Q: "Je peux faire ça gratuitement avec Google Forms"**

```
A: You're right. You could.

Same way you could:
- Track your budget in Excel instead of YNAB
- Build your own CRM in Notion
- Cook every meal instead of ordering delivery

Technically possible. But will you actually do it?

Here's what "DIY" looks like:
1. Create Google Form (30 min)
2. Share manually each month (5 min)
3. Calculate comparisons in spreadsheet (1h)
4. Generate graphs (30 min)
5. Send private links individually (15 min)
6. Do it again next month (2+ hours)

Total: 4-5 hours/month of manual work.

Or: €12/month and FAF does it in 10 minutes.

The question isn't "Can you do it for free?"
The question is "Will you still be doing it in 6 months?"

History says no. That's why FAF exists.
```

**Version courte (TikTok/Social) :**
```
"You could DIY with Google Forms.

Same way you could cook every meal instead of ordering delivery.

Technically possible.

But you won't.

€12/month buys you consistency.

DIY buys you guilt when you don't do it."
```

---

**Q: "J'ai besoin de plus de temps pour décider"**

**Context :** Trial 7 jours se termine, user hésite

**Version Email (Fin trial) :**

```
Subject: Your trial ends today

Hey [Name],

Your Form-a-Friend trial ends today.

I get it—€12/month is a decision.

Two options:

**1. Subscribe now**
Your friendships are worth €0.40/day.
[Subscribe - €12/month]

**2. Not ready yet**
No problem. Your data is safe for 30 days.
Come back when ready.

Questions? Just reply.

Riri
```

**Tone : Pas de pression. Respecte le timing.**

---

**Version Long (Si ils demandent extension) :**

```
I don't extend trials, but I'll tell you this:

The question isn't "Is FAF worth €12/month?"

The question is: "What happens if I don't invest in maintaining my friendships?"

In 5 years, you'll either:
- Have paid €720 and kept your closest friends close
- Have saved €720 and lost them to drift

Your choice.

But make it consciously, not by default.

[Subscribe] or [Come back later]
```

**Tone : Direct, challenge sans manipuler.**

---

**Q: "Mes amis ne vont pas remplir un formulaire"**

```
A: Two scenarios:

**Scenario 1: They fill it (90% of cases)**
Your friends invest 10 minutes because they care about you.

The form gives them permission and structure to share.

Most people find it liberating:
"Finally, an easy way to give updates that actually matter."

**Scenario 2: They don't fill it**
Either they're genuinely swamped (try again in 2 weeks),
or... they don't prioritize your friendship right now.

And in that case, FAF just saved you time and energy.

You now know where to invest.

FAF isn't for forcing people to be your friends.
FAF is for maintaining the friendships that truly matter.
```

**Version courte (FAQ) :**
```
"If they won't invest 10 minutes, maybe that's a signal.

90% fill it. The 10% who don't? You now know where things stand.

FAF reveals priorities. That's a feature, not a bug."
```

---

**Q: "J'attendrai qu'il y ait une version gratuite"**

```
A: FAF will never have a free version. It's a choice.

Why?

Because people who aren't willing to invest €12/month in their friendships aren't our target.

FAF is for Emma: intentional, proactive, who understands that systems > motivation.

If €12/month feels expensive to never lose your friends, FAF probably isn't for you.

And that's okay.

We'd rather have 100 engaged users than 10,000 free users who churn after 2 weeks.
```

**Tone : Assume complètement. Pas d'excuses.**

---

**Q: "Pourquoi pas juste relancer le WhatsApp group ?"**

```
A: Because no one will. And you know it.

Your WhatsApp group has been dead for 4 months. Why?

1. **No one wants to break the silence** (too much social pressure)
2. **It's either flood or desert** (247 messages in 2 hours, then nothing)
3. **It stays superficial** (memes and lol, no real depth)
4. **Asymmetry** (2 people post everything, others just lurk)

FAF solves each of these:
✅ Monthly structure = no constant pressure
✅ Guided questions = natural depth
✅ Asynchronous format = everyone participates when they want
✅ Visible reciprocity = everyone contributes

You could revive the group chat.

Or you could put a system in place that actually works.
```

---

**Q: "€12, c'est beaucoup par mois"**

**Version empathique (Budget serré) :**

```
A: I understand budget matters.

€12/month = €144/year.

For context, that's:
- 6 brunches with friends (€25 each = €150)
- 2 months of Netflix (€14 × 12 = €168)
- Less than 1 concert ticket (€50+)

But here's the real question:

What's one close friendship worth to you over a year?

If the answer is "less than €144", FAF isn't the right investment right now.

If the answer is "way more than that", then €12/month is a bargain.

Only you can decide which is true for you.
```

**Version alternative (Reframe budget) :**

```
"€12/month feels like a lot until you calculate the cost of NOT doing it.

The cost of:
- Realizing at 35 you're alone
- Losing your best friend to drift
- Regretting not staying close when you had the chance

Put a price tag on that regret.

I bet it's more than €144/year."
```

---

**Q: "Je vais y réfléchir"**

**Response (Ne pas laisser en suspens) :**

```
A: Take your time.

But while you're thinking, ask yourself:

**"What am I waiting for?"**

- More features? (The MVP already works)
- Cheaper price? (It won't get cheaper)
- The perfect moment? (There isn't one)
- Proof it works? (That's what the trial is for)

I've learned that "I'll think about it" usually means "no, but I don't want to say it."

And that's okay.

But if the real issue is something else, tell me.

Maybe I can help.
Maybe I can't.

Either way, clarity beats ambiguity.
```

**Tone : Direct, respectueux, challenge gentiment.**

---

### Objection Handling : Guidelines Générales

**DO :**
✅ Acknowledge l'objection (ne jamais dismiss)
✅ Reframe la question (changer l'angle)
✅ Utiliser comparaisons concrètes (gym, Netflix, brunch)
✅ Qualifier l'utilisateur ("if... then FAF is/isn't for you")
✅ Assumer tes choix (paid-only, premium, niche)
✅ Terminer sur note respectueuse ("that's okay")

**DON'T :**
❌ Être défensif ("You don't understand!")
❌ Sur-justifier (10 paragraphes de défense)
❌ Déprécier concurrents (respect Letterloop, etc.)
❌ Fake empathy ("I totally get it BUT...")
❌ Pression manipulative ("Limited time offer!")
❌ Promise plus que le produit ("It will change your life!")

**Principe clé :**
Si quelqu'un n'est pas convaincu après une réponse honnête et claire, ils ne sont pas ta cible. Let them go. Focus sur ceux qui GET IT.

---

### Contexte 5 : Emails (Onboarding)

**Tone :** Direct + Helpful (action-oriented)

**Structure :**
1. **Short greeting** (no fluff)
2. **Clear next steps** (numbered)
3. **One CTA** (don't overwhelm)
4. **Sign-off** (personal, not corporate)

**Exemple :**

```
Subject: You're in. Now let's build the system.

Hey [Name],

You just signed up for Form-a-Friend.

Here's what to do next:

1. Create your form (1 min)
   Dashboard → Create Form → Done

2. Share your link (1 min)
   Copy: faf.app/form/[username]
   Send to 3-5 close friends

3. Fill your own form (8 min)
   Your perception vs theirs = the magic

That's it. You're set up.

Questions? Just reply.

Riri
Form-a-Friend
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- No corporate greeting ("Dear valued customer")
- Action-oriented (numbered steps)
- Time estimates (transparency)
- Human sign-off (Riri, not "The FAF Team")

---

### Contexte 6 : Social Media (TikTok/Twitter)

**Tone :** Direct + Conversational + Slightly provocative

**Structure :**
- Hook (3 sec / first line)
- Body (relatable problem or insight)
- CTA (soft or direct depending on platform)

**Exemple TikTok :**

```
[Hook]
POV: Your best friend got engaged

[Body]
You found out on Instagram
With 247 other people
You used to be the first to know
Now you're just... a follower

[Reflection]
When did this happen?

[CTA]
If you felt this, link in bio.
```

**Exemple Twitter :**

```
The hardest part of building FAF isn't the tech.

It's articulating a problem most people feel but never named:

"Catchup friends"

That moment when you realize you spend 2 hours updating each other instead of actually connecting.

Naming the pain = half the product.
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- Immediate hook (attention span court)
- Emotional resonance (relatable)
- No over-selling (authentic)

---

## Templates par Use Case

### Template 1 : Feature Announcement

**Structure :**
[What's new] → [Why it matters] → [How to use]

**Exemple :**

```
New: Automatic comparison links

Every friend who fills your form now gets a private link.
They can see how their perception compares to yours.

No setup needed. It just works.

[Link to docs if needed]
```

---

### Template 2 : Blog Post Introduction

**Structure :**
[Relatable problem] → [Why it matters] → [What you'll learn]

**Exemple :**

```
You haven't talked to your best friend in 3 months.

Not because you don't care.
Not because you're busy.

You just... forgot.

And now it feels weird to reach out.

This is how friendships die. Slowly. Silently.

In this post, I'll show you the system that prevents this.
```

---

### Template 3 : Testimonial Display

**Structure :**
[Quote] → [Name, age, city] → [Context if relevant]

**Exemple :**

```
"I actually know what's happening in my friends' lives now.
Best €12 I spend every month."

— Emma, 28, Marketing Manager, Paris

(Using FAF for 6 months with her college friends group)
```

**Note :** Keep testimonials SHORT. One powerful sentence > paragraph.

---

### Template 4 : Error Messages / Edge Cases

**Tone :** Direct + Helpful (not corporate, not cute)

**Bad examples to avoid :**
❌ "Oops! Something went wrong!" (not helpful)
❌ "Error 404: Page not found" (too technical)
❌ "Whoopsie daisy!" (too cute)

**Good examples :**

✅ **Payment failed:**
```
Your payment didn't go through.

This usually happens when:
- Card expired
- Insufficient funds
- Bank blocked the transaction

Try again or use a different card.

Need help? Reply to this email.
```

✅ **Form not found:**
```
This form doesn't exist (yet).

Either:
- The link is wrong
- The admin deleted their account

Double-check the URL or contact the person who sent you this link.
```

✅ **Trial expired:**
```
Your 7-day trial ended.

Subscribe to keep access:
[Subscribe - €12/month]

Not ready? Your data is safe for 30 days.
```

**Pourquoi ça marche :**
- Explain what happened (transparent)
- Provide solution (actionable)
- No blame (helpful, not judgy)

---

## Don'ts Absolus

### ❌ Don't #1 : Fake Enthusiasm

**Bad :**
"OMG you guys!!! This is AMAZING!!! 🎉🎉🎉"

**Why it's bad :**
Sounds desperate and insincere. Emma détecte le bullshit.

**Do instead :**
"This is new. Try it and let me know what you think."

---

### ❌ Don't #2 : Corporate Speak

**Bad :**
"We're excited to announce that we're leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver best-in-class solutions."

**Why it's bad :**
Personne ne parle comme ça. C'est vide de sens.

**Do instead :**
"We built a new feature. Here's why it matters."

---

### ❌ Don't #3 : Overpromise

**Bad :**
"Transform your entire social life in 7 days!"

**Why it's bad :**
Pas crédible. FAF est honnête sur ce qu'il fait et ne fait pas.

**Do instead :**
"FAF won't magically fix broken friendships. It prevents good ones from drifting."

---

### ❌ Don't #4 : Apologize for Existing

**Bad :**
"Sorry to bother you, but maybe you might want to consider trying our product if you have time?"

**Why it's bad :**
Weak. FAF assume sa valeur.

**Do instead :**
"If you're struggling with catchup friends, FAF can help. If not, no worries."

---

### ❌ Don't #5 : Use Emojis Excessively

**Bad :**
"Welcome to FAF!!! 🎉🎊🥳💝✨🚀🔥"

**Why it's bad :**
Too casual, unprofessional. FAF is direct and intentional.

**Do instead :**
"Welcome to Form-a-Friend."

**Exception :** 1-2 emojis max in social media, never in product/emails.

---

### ❌ Don't #6 : Jargon or Acronyms (Unless Explained)

**Bad :**
"Our SaaS platform leverages AI-driven NLP to optimize your CRM workflow."

**Why it's bad :**
Alienates non-tech people. Emma n'est pas une techie.

**Do instead :**
"Form-a-Friend helps you stay close with friends through monthly questions."

---
