## Best Practices

### For Large Datasets (>100k documents)
- Enable worker threads for maximum parallelization
- Use adaptive batching for optimal throughput
- Monitor memory usage closely
- Set appropriate checkpoint intervals

### For Resource-Constrained Systems
- Reduce worker thread count
- Lower memory limits
- Enable CPU throttling
- Use smaller batch sizes

### For Production Deployments
- Always perform dry-run first
- Enable full logging and monitoring
- Use checkpoint-based recovery
- Monitor system resources during migration

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Processing Rates
- **Small datasets** (<10k docs): 200-500 docs/sec
- **Medium datasets** (10k-100k docs): 100-300 docs/sec
- **Large datasets** (>100k docs): 50-150 docs/sec

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU**: 70-85% utilization (with throttling)
- **Memory**: 60-80% of available RAM
- **I/O**: Optimized with bulk operations
- **Network**: Minimal overhead with connection pooling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size or worker thread count
2. **Slow Processing**: Enable worker threads and adaptive batching
3. **Database Timeouts**: Optimize connection settings and use bulk operations
4. **High CPU Usage**: Enable CPU throttling and reduce parallelization

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Migration Interrupted**: Script automatically resumes from checkpoint
2. **Data Corruption**: Automatic rollback to backup if enabled
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Circuit breaker prevents system overload
4. **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
