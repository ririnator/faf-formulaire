## Medium Severity Issues Identified

### M1: formRoutes.js Lacks Comprehensive Security Controls
**Location**: `/Users/ririnator/Desktop/FAF/backend/routes/formRoutes.js`
**Issue**: Legacy form route lacks modern security middleware stack
**Risk**: Potential for exploitation of legacy endpoint
**Current State**: Basic validation only, no rate limiting, CSRF, or advanced input sanitization
**Recommendation**: 
```javascript
// Add comprehensive security middleware
router.use(createFormBodyParser());
router.use(createQuerySanitizationMiddleware());
router.use(detectAuthMethod);
router.use(rateLimiting.formLimiter);
router.post('/response', 
  csrfProtectionPublic(), // For legacy compatibility
  validateResponseStrict,
  handleValidationErrors,
  sanitizeResponse,
  // ... existing handler
);
```

### M2: Insufficient Error Information Disclosure Protection
**Location**: Multiple route files
**Issue**: Some error messages expose internal system details
**Risk**: Information disclosure aiding attackers
**Examples**:
- Database error messages in contact routes
- Stack traces in development mode leaking to production
**Recommendation**: Implement centralized error sanitization middleware

---

**Recommendation**: Integrate with performance alerting system for real-time notifications

### L2: Rate Limiting Statistics Not Exposed
**Location**: Various rate limiting implementations
**Issue**: No administrative visibility into rate limiting effectiveness
**Risk**: Inability to tune rate limits based on actual usage patterns
**Recommendation**: Add rate limiting statistics endpoint for administrators

### L3: CSV Security Monitoring Needs Enhancement  
**Location**: `/Users/ririnator/Desktop/FAF/backend/middleware/csvSecurityMonitoring.js`
**Issue**: CSV security events not integrated with main security monitoring
