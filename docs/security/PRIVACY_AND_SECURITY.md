# üîê Privacy and Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the privacy and security measures implemented in the FAF authentication system to protect user data and prevent sensitive information exposure.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Improvements

### 1. **Sensitive Data Logging Prevention**

**Issue Fixed**: Authentication middleware was logging user paths and behavior patterns in development mode, potentially exposing:
- User access patterns
- Token values in URLs
- User IDs and session identifiers
- Authentication timing patterns

**Solution Implemented**:
- Centralized privacy configuration (`config/privacy.js`)
- Path redaction for sensitive URLs
- Aggregate-only authentication statistics
- Explicit opt-in required for any auth logging

### 2. **Privacy Configuration**

#### Blacklisted Fields (Never Logged)
```javascript
- password
- token
- sessionId
- email
- userId
- responses
- migrateToken
- csrfToken
```

#### Path Redaction Patterns
```javascript
/api/view/[TOKEN]        ‚Üí /api/view/[REDACTED]
/api/users/[USER_ID]     ‚Üí /api/users/[REDACTED]
/api/responses/[ID]      ‚Üí /api/responses/[REDACTED]
```

### 3. **Environment Variables for Privacy Control**

```bash
# Development Privacy Settings
VERBOSE_AUTH_LOGS=false         # Must be explicitly true to log auth events
DEBUG_STACK_TRACES=false        # Must be true to see stack traces
PERFORMANCE_LOGGING=false       # Must be true for performance metrics

# Production Privacy Settings  
PRODUCTION_LOGGING=false        # Never log sensitive data in production
PRIVACY_OVERRIDE=false          # Emergency override (use with caution)
GDPR_COMPLIANCE=true           # Enable GDPR compliance features
REQUIRE_CONSENT=true           # Require user consent for data processing
ANALYTICS_SALT=<random>        # Salt for anonymous ID generation
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Logging Guidelines

1. **Never Log**:
   - User passwords (even hashed)
   - Authentication tokens
   - Session IDs
   - Email addresses
   - User-specific paths
   - Stack traces in production

2. **Always Sanitize**:
   - User input before logging
   - Error messages
   - API responses
   - Database queries

3. **Use Aggregate Metrics**:
   - Count authentication attempts by type
   - Track performance by endpoint category
   - Monitor errors by type, not user

### Privacy Utilities

#### `PrivacyUtils.sanitizeForLogging(obj)`
Recursively sanitizes objects, replacing sensitive fields with `[REDACTED]`.

#### `PrivacyUtils.redactPath(path)`
Redacts sensitive parts of URL paths while preserving structure.

#### `PrivacyUtils.generateAnonymousId(identifier)`
Creates consistent anonymous IDs for analytics without exposing real user IDs.

#### `PrivacyUtils.canLog(dataType)`
Checks if logging is allowed based on environment and privacy settings.

## üìä Audit Logging

For compliance and security monitoring, use the audit logging feature:

```javascript
SecureLogger.logAudit('user_login', userId, {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  ip: req.ip // Will be sanitized
});
```

Audit logs:
- Use anonymous user IDs
- Are GDPR-compliant when enabled
- Track only necessary security events
- Can be exported for compliance reporting

## üö® Security Checklist

- [ ] All logging uses `SecureLogger` class
- [ ] No direct `console.log` of user data
- [ ] Privacy configuration reviewed
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] Path redaction patterns cover all sensitive routes
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for security events
- [ ] Regular review of logged data for leaks

## üîÑ Migration from Old Logging

If you have existing code using direct logging:

```javascript
// OLD - INSECURE
console.log(`User ${userId} accessed ${req.path}`);

// NEW - SECURE
SecureLogger.logAuth(req.method, 'REDACTED', req.authMethod);
```

## üìà Monitoring Without Compromising Privacy

### Recommended Metrics (Privacy-Safe)

1. **Authentication Metrics**:
   - Total login attempts per hour
   - Success/failure ratio
   - Auth method distribution (token vs user)

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Average response time by endpoint type
   - Database query performance
   - Cache hit rates

3. **Error Metrics**:
   - Error types and frequencies
   - Recovery success rates
   - System health indicators

### Metrics to Avoid

- User-specific access patterns
- Individual session durations
- Personal data in error logs
- Identifiable user behaviors

## üéØ Testing Privacy

Run privacy tests to ensure no data leaks:

```bash
# Check for sensitive data in logs
npm run test:privacy

# Audit log output for leaks
npm run audit:logs

# Verify sanitization is working
npm run test:sanitization
```

## üìù Compliance

This implementation supports:
- **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten, data minimization
- **CCPA**: Consumer privacy rights
- **PIPEDA**: Canadian privacy regulations
- **Security Standards**: OWASP logging guidelines

## üöÄ Future Improvements

1. Implement structured logging with log levels
2. Add log rotation and archival
3. Integrate with SIEM systems
4. Add anomaly detection for security events
5. Implement differential privacy for analytics
